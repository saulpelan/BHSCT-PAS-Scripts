# CRT-PAS-Scripts
This repo is a portfolio of the scripts I have developed for the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust PAS Support Team to aid the maintenance of the three Patient Administration Systems.

The Patient Administration Systems for the three Belfast Trust hospitals are each a system called CliniCom, developed by Shared Medical Systems Limited (SMS UK) and now supported by [DXC Technology](https://dxc.technology).

CliniCom is a "green screen terminal" mainframe system that was originally accessed by terminals. Nowadays it is accessed by PCs with terminal emulation software.
